# life_tracker
Personal custom mobile app for tracking daily activities, mood etc.

This is my custom project to integrate how I fell and what activities I do throughout my life. This app was created as manually opening google sheets was annoying and no one else had made a good enough app lol. 

To-do: 
- Add reminders about missing data for yesterday and the day before beneath the calendar overview
- Maybe add random inspirational quote below as well? (future)
- Add notifications for 10 pm? and 9 am? "Remember to add data"
- Test on actual phone lol
