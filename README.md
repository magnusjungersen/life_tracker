# Life Tracker
Personal custom mobile app for tracking daily activities, mood etc.

This is my custom project to integrate how I fell and what activities I do throughout my life. This app was created as manually opening google sheets was annoying and no one else had made a good enough app lol. 

## Files needed
Assets folder expects config.json:
{
  "release": {
    "spreadsheetID": "your spreadsheetID",
    "worksheetTitle": "your worksheetTitle"
  }
}

and credentials.json for google sheets document. 

### How to install
- Using VS Code flutter plugin is recommended. 
- Connect phone and make sure device is connected in VS code. 
- "flutter run --release" in terminal to install production version on device

- Tracking
