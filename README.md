# life_tracker
Personal custom mobile app for tracking daily activities, mood etc.

This is my custom project to integrate how I fell and what activities I do throughout my life. This app was created as manually opening google sheets was annoying and no one else had made a good enough app lol. 

### How to install
Using VS Code flutter plugin is recommended. 
Connect phone and make sure device is connected in VS code. 
"flutter run --release" in terminal to install production version on device
